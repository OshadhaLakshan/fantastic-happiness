The Audio Aura Description:

    AVG(energy) AS average_energy,
    AVG(valence) AS average_valence
FROM songs;

- Energy Average: 0.65906
- Valence Average: 0.484443
- Danceability Average: 0.71646
========================================

Hypothesis on Representativity:

- Temporal data: The top songs from 2018 indeed are not representing what the listeners are feeling now.
- Personal Context - The songs that one would select in 2018 might have ideally reflected their life situations at that point, which are no longer the same now.
- Size of Population-Only 100 songs were considered in the data and which is small to generalize the varieties available in choices in the listeners' profiles.
========================================

Better Calculation Method:

- Time analysis-measure the trends concerning popularity of songs over the extended time period.
- Several Sources-Not only talk about the information from other sources like Spotify, Apple as well.
